Motivation

html2pdf's purpose is to convert Web-based manuals to PDF for enabling full-text search.

html2pdf is an intellectual tool that can significantly reduce the time spent searching for information in web-books and web-manuals.

html2pdf is an important part of the development of the pdf2knowlegeTree (pdf2knt) project as another more powerful intellectual support tool.

pdf2knt is needed to build a tree of knowledge based on one or more pdf-files.

pdf2knt should automatically create a dictionary of available words and then on its basis to help build a hierarchy of concepts, their definitions, explanations, and examples of use.

After building a knowledge tree, pdf2knt should allow you to find all the available information on a particular topic in a matter of seconds based on all the sources involved.
